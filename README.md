# CSE327.10 Project - Pashe Achi     
"Pashe Achi" is a web application which is developed and designed to provide medical benefits through the internet. A patient will be able to search for specialist doctors, book and cancel appointments online, and they can also check if the doctor they need is available at that time. Moreover, a patient can access his appointment history. Via this web application, doctors will be able to view and cancel their appointments. Patients can further add ratings to the doctor in order to review their service. The main aim of our project is to save time and money by giving the users a platform where they themselves can access useful information and update changes if necessary. Our system, therefore, will make the appointment process more convenient, easier, and secure.
